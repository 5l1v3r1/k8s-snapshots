2.0.0 (2017-08-26)
------------------

Adds support for cloud backends.

IMPORTANT BREAKING CHANGES

- The VOLUMES options has been replaced by a custom SnapshotRule
  resource. If you need to setup manual snapshot rules for disks not
  based on a PersistentVolume resource, see the readme for instructions.

Other changes

- Support an AWS backend.
- Improve GCE disk detection; now based on actual data data, not on a
  provisioner label.
- GLCOUD_PROJECT environment variable no longer required, is read from
  instance metadata.


1.0.1 (2017-08-16)
------------------

- Fix manual volume support via VOLUMES.
- Fix race condition that caused PersistentVolume resources not be be
  watched.


1.0 (2017-08-10)
----------------

Vastly improved rewrite. Joar Wandborg contributed most of the changes
in this release.


IMPORTANT BREAKING CHANGES

- *k8s-snapshots* now labels the snapshots it creates, and only looks
  at those snapshots that have this label when making decisions about
  when to create and delete snapshots.

  Thus, when you upgrade, all existing snapshots will be invisible to
  *k8s-snapshots*, and it will begin with a blank slate.

  We recommend that within the Google Cloud UI, you add the label to
  your existing snapshots you want the tool to consider. The label
  expected is:

  created-by=k8s-snapshots

- The format used to define deltas has changed. It now uses ISO 8601
  durations, so the annotation string will look like this:

  backup.kubernetes.io/deltas: PT1H P30D P180D

  This is 1 hour, 30 days and 180 days.
