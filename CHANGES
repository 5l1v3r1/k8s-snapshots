1.0 (2017-08-10)
----------------

Vastly improved rewrite. Joar Wandborg contributed most of the changes
in this release.


IMPORTANT BREAKING CHANGES

- *k8s-snapshots* now labels the snapshots it creates, and only looks
  at those snapshots that have this label when making decisions about
  when to create and delete snapshots.

  Thus, when you upgrade, all existing snapshots will be invisible to
  *k8s-snapshots*, and it will begin with a blank slate.

- The format used to define deltas has changed. It now uses ISO 8601
  durations, so the annotation string will look like this:

  backup.kubernetes.io/deltas: PT1H P30D P180D

  This is 1 hour, 30 days and 180 days.
